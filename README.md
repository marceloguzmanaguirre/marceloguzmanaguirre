## Hello! Welcome to my Github Profile!
I'm Marcelo, a student passionate about <ins>**making an impact through data-driven solutions**</ins>. While studying at Notre Dame, I'm exploring how technology and migration are changing the way we live and work. When I'm not analyzing market strategies or mentoring students, you'll find me writing about my cultural heritage, leading community initiatives, or exploring contemporary Hispanic authors.

### 🎓 Education 🎓
At the **University of Notre Dame**, I'm pursuing a double major in **Economics** and **Romance Languages and Literature-Spanish**, with a minor in **Data Science**

___

### 🧠 Goals & Interests 🧠
- Gain a strong foundation in <ins>data exploration</ins> through interactive tools built with Streamlit, applying filtering, selection, and visualization techniques using libraries like Pandas and Seaborn.
- Build and evaluate <ins>supervised learning models</ins> such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, focusing on user-guided training, model metrics, and visual interpretation using scikit-learn.
- Apply <ins>unsupervised learning methods</ins> including KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and PCA to uncover patterns in datasets, with an emphasis on dimensionality reduction and cluster visualization.
