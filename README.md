## Hello! Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Marcelo, a student passionate about <ins>**making an impact through data-driven solutions**</ins>. While studying at Notre Dame, I'm exploring how technology and migration are changing the way we live and work. When I'm not analyzing market strategies or mentoring students, you'll find me writing about my cultural heritage, leading community initiatives, or exploring contemporary Hispanic authors.
